<H1>System Analysis Project</H1>
<p>During my time in system analysis, my group and I did a project in which we create were required to create documentaion for a hypothectical system. The system we were given was book selling service for students that could fulfill the requirements listed. A sample of these requirements including:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The seller can set or change the price of a book.</li>
    <li>Users can fill out froms to add deatils for a given book.</li>
    <li>The service can be searched using keywords.</li>
    <li>Buyers have shopping chart to store items that want to buy later.</li>
    <li>The seller is notified when the sale is completed.</li>
    <li>Buyers are notified with a code and the pickup location.</li>
    </ol>
    <img src="Images/Use%20Case%204.png" class="center">
<p>The first piece of documentation we had to produced was the use case diagram. The diagram serves to illustrate two purposes. The first is illustrate the relationship of users with processes. The other is to relate process with each other. An example of the first is looking at the difference between the buyer and seller. The seller is only connected to  set book price and create account.</p>
<p>The other type of relationships to note are those between processes. In the diagram, includes indicates that that one process has to take place before another. In this example,a refund can only occur if the user has checked out. An extended relationship is where a process is a variation of an existing process. This relationship can show with the correlation can be seen with search as extended search/advanced search.</p>
    <img src="Images/Class%20Diagram2.png" class="center">
<p>If the use case diagram represents the actions in system then the class diagram represents the objects within it. The diagram shows the name of class at top, its attributes in middle and possible methods. The connections between classes are illustrated by the various types of lines that exist. Lines with no arrow at the end show two classes interacting while the arrow present the relationships. White arrows repesent that two classes are kind of each other i.e a seller is type of an account in this account.Black arrows show the opposite when the class is a part of another one.The other part of a class diagram are multiplities,the numbers on the side of the classes. They indicate the numberic relationships between the classes.</p>
<p>In our group project, these two documents are the ones where I was primary contributer. Others that were done more collaboratively such as use case processes, sequence diagrams,and final presentation presentation aren't included.To give credit to where it is due the requirements list above was done by a teammate.</p>
