<p>     Alternate history is a topic that is pretty underrated compared to its sister genre,Steampunk. Alternate history's main appeal is different to that of Steampunk. The genre's main is too look a the trends in history and look at in a different way. The best one recognize how thier change would realistically affect the world. Seeing a world similar but different from our own is what the worldbuilding so satisfying here. The writer has to make a sharp balance between making apply to the rules of our universe and keep it interesting at the same time.</p>
<p>     Another aspect that makes stand out is the relative to other genre's is intergration of the audience to the creation process. Due to the small pool of actually published work out there, a vast majority of it is self published for free. The works here are exceptionally the product of fans enjoy something they admire. In really no other genre's do they,the fans, have the relative control. Whether it be making maps, flags, or writing there own timelines, this to me the ultimate appeal. Euthnastic people discussing what they love.</p>
