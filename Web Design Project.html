<Html>
<p>For my final project, I'd decided use to my website from Web administration. It was not originally a project but rather a assignment that was continously updated over the cuase of the semester. I choose it anyway becuase it was my real first serious attempt of using HTML, CSS and Javascript, and feel it could work as look back at that experience. The links above have the webpages embeded in this portfolio and will refer to them rather than insterting images.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Althist or Alternate History was the first page to be created and pretty much directed how the assignment was designed. The page was initally just an empty page with the could now be the "article" on it. As further assignements were given such as adding CSS and forms, the direction that the site when was one of a blog. Each element added with that in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>The general layout of CSS was modeled on how blogs were usually designed with a long header containing a logo, space for the article and some form navigation.</li>
<li>Eventually we were required to add forms to out sites for an assignment, one standard and another on existing page. For mine came in from of a "comments section" to the althist page and creation of the Suggestions page.</li>
<li>The final addition was the index, here named the archive, as we required to host our sites on Github which requires an index to serve as the site's homepage. The archive came as a listing of an archive all existing articles.</li>
