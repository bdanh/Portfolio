<p>The web form above is based in project prompt for Food Truck. The purpose of the prompt was to create a system where customers could order online before going up to the hypothetical food truck. The output of project was a wireframe, a form, a database and finally connecting page with the its database.</p>
<p>The form is mostly complete with the exception of output an total price and order code which currently does output either value. For the overview of the form,it is three parts. The first is introduction which includes the welcoming text, total price and order code for customer. The second part ask for the customer information and lastly is the menu to order thier items.<p>

        <img src="Images/SQL%20Tables.png" class="center">
<p>The sample of code above is above illustrates the form connecting to the database. The customer's First ad Last Names are recorded add into the table customer in a relative simple way. The menu items ordered are handled in a more complicated way. All menu item are checked individually then saved into an array which would be printed and queried. Other items in the database not connected to the input form are the keys for the customer and order tables and attributes relating to the location of truck. This table is used to keep track of where an order was taken and how much sales that location had.</p>

<p>The final deliverable for the project was itswire frame.Despite being listed last, the wireframe served as the draft for from as whole. As you can see, it is more similar than different to final outcome. Here are some of the explain for the omission between the draft and final designs:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The assignment required we make the wireframe in form a webpage so the web elements(footer,logo,banner) were excluded.</li>
    <li>Original the from used icons or radio boxes for input but that did not account. That orders multiples of an item.</li>
    <li>The payment was three most formatted textbox rather than simply one.</li>
